# notes — `sessions` teammate (wave 1, M2)

Working notes for the PRO / SES track. Not a plan document: `01-prd.md` defines, `09` describes,
this file only records how I am building it and what I found. Append as I go.

---

## 0. Two discrepancies found on day one (lead, please read)

**0.1 — My screen numbers do not match `09`.** My agent definition says "screens SCR-008 … SCR-012
and SCR-014 (the event page)". In `09-sitemap-screens.md` the event page is **SCR-012**, SCR-014 is
**check-in** (`checkin`'s), and SCR-008/SCR-009 do not exist. `09` owns the `SCR-*` ID space, so I
follow `09`. My screens are:

| Screen | Route | Story |
|---|---|---|
| SCR-017 propose | `/app/propose` | PRO-001, PRO-002 |
| SCR-018 my proposal | `/app/propose/[id]` | PRO-004 |
| SCR-011 browse | `/app/sessions` | SES-006 (and DSC in M5) |
| SCR-012 **the event page** | `/app/sessions/[id]` | SES-006, the three slots |
| SCR-041 review queue | `/app/admin/proposals` | PRO-003 |
| SCR-042 sessions management | `/app/admin/sessions` | SES-002 |
| SCR-043 schedule and publish | `/app/admin/sessions/[id]/schedule` | SES-001 |
| SCR-046 venues | `/app/admin/venues` | SES-004 |

**0.2 — Four of those are under `app/admin/**`, which was not in my glob list. Resolved as
DEC-042.** `TEAM.md` gives `app/admin/**` to `console` in wave 3, but PRO-003, SES-001, SES-002 and
SES-004 are M2 and mine, and the M2 demonstrable ("propose → approve → schedule → publish → …")
cannot happen without them. The lead extended my ownership for wave 1 to
`src/app/[locale]/app/admin/{proposals,sessions,venues}/**` and `src/messages/{ar,en}/admin.json`,
handed to `console` at wave 3.

## 1. STORY-PRO-001 — propose a topic, and nothing schedule-shaped

**Covers:** `REQ-PRO-001`, `REQ-PRO-002` · **Screen:** SCR-017 · **Size:** M

### 1.1 What the requirement actually asks for

`REQ-PRO-001` is a **schema** claim before it is a form claim: "The proposal form **and its
validation schema** contain no date, time or venue field." Migration `0010` already holds up its
half — `public.proposals` has no such column, and `02` §4.3 says so in bold. My half is the Zod
schema and the form. The ★ acceptance in `15-backlog.md` is checked by a test that reads the
schema's own key set, not by a human scanning the JSX.

`REQ-PRO-002` fixes the field list and pins three Arabic labels to copy members have already read
on the live registration form.

### 1.2 The label match, and the one place I deviate

From `src/messages/ar/marketing.json` (frozen copy, lead-only — I read it, I do not touch it):

| Field | Pre-launch label | Proposal label | Same? |
|---|---|---|---|
| العنوان | `register.topicTitleLabel` = «عنوان الموضوع المقترح» | «عنوان الموضوع المقترح» | identical |
| التصنيف | `register.categoryLabel` = «تصنيف الموضوع» | «تصنيف الموضوع» | identical |
| النبذة | `register.descriptionLabel` = «نبذة عن موضوعك (جملة أو جملتان)» | «نبذة عن موضوعك» | **label identical, parenthetical dropped** |

The parenthetical «(جملة أو جملتان)» was a *constraint of the short pre-launch form*, where the
field capped at 600 characters and the copy promised «سنجهّز التفاصيل معك لاحقًا». On the platform
`abstract` runs to 2000 characters and is the text an admin reviews. Keeping "a sentence or two" on
a 2000-character field would be a false instruction, so it moves to the hint line («اشرح فكرتك
ومن سيستفيد منها») and the **label** — which is what `REQ-PRO-002` binds — is identical.

The four seeded categories are the four pre-launch ones, verified against
`0005_tenancy_rpcs.sql:371`: فني · إداري · إبداعي · درس من تجربة. Nothing to align.

Copy above the form, from `09` SCR-017 and the live site: «لست بحاجة لأن تكون خبيرًا.»

### 1.3 DAL — `src/lib/dal/proposals.ts`

`import "server-only"`, every function through `sessionClient()`, every return a DTO.

```
ProposalCategory  { id, name }
ProposalSummary   { id, title, categoryName, level, state, decisionReason, createdAt, updatedAt }
ProposalDetail    = ProposalSummary + { abstract, targetAudience, expectedDurationMinutes, adminNotes, categoryId }

listCategories(locale)            → ProposalCategory[]     active only, ordered by name
listMyProposals(locale)           → ProposalSummary[]      proposer_id = session.memberId, newest first
createProposal(locale, input, submit) → { id }             state 'draft' | 'submitted'
getOrgNumerals(locale)            → 'western' | 'arabic'   org_settings.numerals, REQ-INT-006
```

No RPC is needed to **create or submit**. `03` §5.2b is explicit: the asymmetric `using` /
`with check` on `proposals_update_own_editable` *is* the state machine, and `proposals_insert_own`
already permits `draft` and `submitted`. A plain insert is the right call; inventing an RPC here
would be ceremony that the policy already performs.

`decision_reason` is deliberately absent from the insert and from the input type — it is not in the
column grant either, so a proposer cannot write their own rejection reason at any layer.

### 1.4 The Server Action — `src/app/[locale]/app/propose/actions.ts`

`proposalInput` (Zod 4, shape not authority):

```
title                     string, trimmed, 3–150
abstract                  string, trimmed, 1–2000
categoryId                uuid
level                     enum introductory | intermediate | advanced
targetAudience            string ≤ 300, nullable
expectedDurationMinutes   int 15–480, nullable
adminNotes                string ≤ 2000, nullable
```

Mirrors the table's own checks so a violation is a field error, not a 23514 from Postgres. **There
is no date, time, venue, capacity or deadline key, and adding one is a test failure** — see 1.6.

One action, `submitProposal(formData)`, with an `intent` of `draft` or `submit`. Not two actions:
Server Actions dispatch one at a time per client and the two differ by a single boolean.
`redirect()` on success, back to `/app/propose?created=<id>&state=<state>`; on a Zod failure it
re-renders with field errors rather than redirecting to `?error=1`, because a 2000-character
abstract must not be thrown away (the pre-launch form's own copy promises «بياناتك ما زالت في
النموذج» and members will expect the same).

`useActionState` on a client wrapper for the error state; the fields keep their values.

### 1.5 Proposed SQL — `supabase/proposed/sessions/0001_proposal_transitions.sql`

Two things, and the reason they are a **trigger** and not an RPC:

1. **`proposals_audit_transition()`** — `after insert or update of state`, `security definer`,
   calls `public.write_audit(...)` with `proposal.created` / `proposal.submitted` / etc. and
   `before` / `after` jsonb. `REQ-PRO-006` says "No transition occurs without an audit row".
   `write_audit` is revoked from `authenticated` and granted only to `service_role`
   (`0005_tenancy_rpcs.sql`), so the row can only be written from a definer context. **If I put
   that in an RPC, the audit would be optional** — `03` §5.2b lets a member submit with a plain
   PostgREST `update`, bypassing any RPC I write. A trigger makes the audit row a property of the
   table, which is what "no transition occurs without" means.
2. **`proposals_guard_transition()`** — `before update of state`, the legal edge set of
   `REQ-PRO-006` (`draft → submitted`, `submitted → in_review | approved | rejected |
   changes_requested`, `in_review → …`, `changes_requested → submitted`), raising `23514` on
   anything else. The policy permits `changes_requested → draft`, which is a skip; `REQ-PRO-006`
   says "a proposal cannot skip states; the diagram in `02` is normative".

Header carries the `REQ-*` served and the `03` §8.2 rows, per `TEAM.md` §2.

### 1.6 Tests

| Test | File | What it pins |
|---|---|---|
| the schema has no schedule-shaped key | `tests/unit/…` → **no**, my glob is `tests/components/sessions/**`; it goes in `tests/components/sessions/proposal-schema.test.ts` | ★ `REQ-PRO-001`: `Object.keys(proposalInput.shape)` contains none of date/time/venue/capacity/deadline, and the strict schema **rejects** an object carrying one |
| labels match the pre-launch form | `tests/components/sessions/proposal-labels.test.ts` | reads `ar/marketing.json` and `ar/proposals.json` and asserts the three labels |
| all six ICU plural forms | same file | every key with a count carries zero/one/two/few/many/other |
| audit row on create and on submit | `tests/rls/proposals-transitions.test.ts` (`applyProposed()`) | `REQ-PRO-006` |
| illegal transition rejected | same | `changes_requested → draft` raises 23514 |
| a member cannot write `decision_reason` | same | column grant, 42501 |
| another org's proposal is invisible | same | `proposals_read_own_or_staff` |
| propose end to end | `tests/e2e/sessions-propose.spec.ts` | form submits, lands with the success state, the row exists |

The generated isolation sweep already walks `proposals`; nothing to add there.

### 1.7 Messages

`src/messages/ar/proposals.json` first (invariant 10), `en/` twin after, namespace `proposals`
added to `NAMESPACES` in `src/messages/index.ts` — the one shared line, appended, never reordered.
Keys are `feature.screen.element` and stable: `propose.form.title`, `propose.form.titleHint`, …

`<bdi>` on every interpolated value (the proposal title in the list and in the success banner).
Logical properties only. The duration numeral follows `org_settings.numerals`.

### 1.8 The 390 px RTL screenshot

One capture of `/ar/app/propose` at 390 px in the Playwright phone project, looked at by me, not
just taken. What I am checking: no horizontal scroll, the submit control ≥ 44 px and reachable, the
category `select` opening right-to-left, the hint lines not clipping tashkeel (no `overflow: hidden`
on a text line), and the number input's Latin digits sitting inside an RTL line without the label
and the unit swapping places.

## 2. STORY-PRO-002 — co-presenters, and the half that is blocked

**Covers:** `REQ-PRO-003` · **Screens:** SCR-017, SCR-018 · **Size:** M

### 2.1 `REQ-PRO-004` (draft materials) cannot be built in wave 1

There is no `materials` table. `0010` covers proposals, presenters, sessions, transitions, RSVPs,
codes, check-ins, attempts, comments, reactions, reports, ratings and the aggregates view, and
nothing else; `ENT-materials` arrives with M5, which is the `content` teammate in wave 2. Its
requirement also says draft materials "obey every materials rule (`REQ-MAT-*`)", none of which
exists yet. So STORY-PRO-002 ships its `REQ-PRO-003` half now and `REQ-PRO-004` waits for M5.
When it lands it is a small addition: attach on SCR-017, admin-only until publication, carried over
with its phase.

### 2.2 Three holes the schema left, closed in `0002_copresenters.sql`

1. **A named presenter could be in another org.** `proposal_presenters_insert_by_proposer` checks
   that the ROW's `org_id` is the caller's and that the proposal is theirs. Neither says the named
   MEMBER is in that org. `REQ-PRO-003` says only same-org members may be named, and A5's presenter
   points and `REQ-CRT-001`'s certificate follow the named row — so this is a tenancy hole, not a
   validation nicety. Closed by `presenter_is_same_org()` on **both** presenter tables.
2. **A co-presenter could be added to an already-approved proposal**, collecting presenter points
   and a certificate for a session nobody reviewed them onto. Naming now closes at the decision and
   stays open through review, because a change-request often *is* "add someone who knows the
   operations side". Deletes are deliberately **not** state-locked: a decline can arrive at any
   time and `REQ-PRO-003` says the declined member is removed.
3. **Creating a proposal with presenters was three PostgREST calls, so three transactions.** A bad
   co-presenter id would have left a proposal with nobody presenting it. `create_proposal()` makes
   it one act. It is `security invoker` — it exists for **atomicity, not authority**, so RLS and
   the column grants still decide, and it takes no `proposer_id` or `org_id` because both come from
   the claims and there is therefore no argument to lie in.

### 2.3 The proposer is a presenter row

`create_proposal()` writes the proposer's own `proposal_presenters` row with `accepted = true`.
Proposing is accepting. It also makes `presenters_within_limit`'s `max_co_presenters + 1` mean what
it says — the lead presenter plus four — which is how `tests/rls/m2-schema.test.ts` already reads
it ("presenter + attendee = 2 = max_co_presenters + 1").

### 2.4 SCR-018 exists now, thinly

A named co-presenter has to be able to *reach* their invitation, so `/app/propose/[id]` and a short
"مقترحاتي" list at the foot of SCR-017 arrive with this story. The pipeline view `REQ-PRO-008`
describes — the history behind each state — is still STORY-PRO-004.

Who may open SCR-018 is `proposals_read_own_or_staff`, not a check in the page: the proposer and
the named co-presenters, nobody else. A member who is neither gets no row, and no row is a **404**
rather than a message that would confirm the id exists.
