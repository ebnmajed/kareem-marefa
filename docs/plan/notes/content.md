# notes — `content` teammate (wave 2, M5)

Working notes for the MAT / TSK / photos (EVT-009…015) / DSC track. Not a plan document —
`01-prd.md` defines, `07-content-pipeline.md` describes the pipeline, `02`/`03` are frozen for the
schema and the policy shape; this file only records how I am building it. Append as I go.

---

## 0. Reading order and what I found before writing anything

Read, in order: `STATUS.md` (wave 2 section), `CLAUDE.md` § Agent team + the invariants table,
`DECISIONS.md` DEC-005, 006, 009, 031, 032, 040…046, `TEAM.md` §1–3, §5, `07-content-pipeline.md`
whole, `03-permissions-rls.md` §2 (helpers), §5.5, §5.6c/d, §6, §8.2, `02-domain-model.md` §3, §4.2,
§4.6, §4.7, §4.15, §7, `11-background-jobs.md` §2.4, `01-prd.md` MAT/TSK/EVT-009…015/DSC/PRO-004,
`15-backlog.md` STORY-MAT-*/TSK-*/DSC-*/EVT-005-006, `notes/sessions.md` §2.1, `notes/event.md`.

**Two things worth flagging up front, before the schema:**

**0.1 — `tags`, `session_tags` and `bookmarks` do not exist anywhere yet.** `02` §4.2 lists
`ENT-tags`/`ENT-session_tags` under "Taxonomy and venues" next to `categories`/`venues`, which
*sounds* like wave-0 (M1 tenancy) territory, but neither migration `0004` (tenancy) nor `0010` (M2
schema) created them — only `categories` and `venues` did. They serve `REQ-DSC-002`/`REQ-DSC-006`,
which are mine. So they are part of my first proposed file, not a gap in someone else's.

**0.2 — Three forward references `0010` already left for me, on purpose:**
- `reports.photo_id uuid` — bare, no FK, comment `-- M5 adds the reference`. I add the constraint.
- `has_checked_in()`, `is_presenter_of()` — already defined and already granted
  (`grant execute on function public.is_presenter_of(uuid), public.has_checked_in(uuid) to
  authenticated, anon, service_role`), so photo and material-version writes use them as-is.
- `public.enqueue_job()` (`0025`) — the only door to the queue; my jobs enqueue through it, and
  until then a `TODO(content)`-style call site is fine (there is no `notify()` dependency in my
  jobs the way `scoring`/`notify` have — no notification is required by any `REQ-MAT-*`/`REQ-TSK-*`
  acceptance in this first schema pass; `REQ-TSK-005` reminders are `notify`'s job body, not mine).

**0.3 — `sessions.search_vector` is an `alter table` on a table I do not own the app code for.**
Same pattern as `reports.photo_id`: additive schema DDL, not app code, permitted under DEC-046's
"hooks into M2 are SQL only." `REQ-DSC-003`/`004` cannot exist without it. Flagged here for the
lead the way `sessions`/`event` flagged their own cross-cutting SQL.

---

## 1. First proposed file — `supabase/proposed/content/0001_m5_schema.sql`

**Serves:** `02` §4.6 (materials, tasks), §4.7 (photos — `photos`, `photo_takedowns`, the
`reports.photo_id` FK), §4.2 + §4.15 (tags, session_tags, bookmarks, search) · `03` §5.5, §5.6c,
§6 · `REQ-MAT-001`…`012`, `REQ-TSK-001`…`005`, `REQ-EVT-009`…`014` (schema half), `REQ-DSC-001`…
`007`.

### 1.1 Tables, in the order they appear in the file

`materials` → `material_versions` → `material_pages` (circular FK on
`materials.current_version_id` resolved with an `alter table … add constraint` once
`material_versions` exists, same trick `0010` used for `reports.photo_id`) → `session_tasks` →
`task_completions` → `task_form_responses` → `photos` → `photo_takedowns` → the `reports.photo_id`
FK → `tags` → `session_tags` → `bookmarks` → `ar_normalize()` + `sessions.search_vector` +
its two indexes.

Every table carries `org_id not null` per `02` §7 — there is no fifth exception here.

### 1.2 Policies copied verbatim from `03`, not reinvented

Three policies already have literal SQL written in `03` (a `settled` document) even though no
migration implements them yet — I copied them rather than re-deriving the logic:

- `materials_read` — §5.5a, the phase gate.
- `responses_read` — §5.5b, presenter/admin/self on `task_form_responses`.
- `photos_insert_checked_in` — §5.6c, the check-in gate + `exif_stripped` conjunct.

### 1.3 Policies I designed from the P1–P8 patterns (`03` §4) plus the per-table summary rows
(`03` §5.5, §5.6), because `03` gives the shape ("P8 + P2", "P7 + presenter") but not the SQL

| Table | select | insert | update | delete |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `materials` | §5.5a (copied) | P8 | `materials_update_presenter` + `materials_update_admin` (see §1.4) | P2 (hard delete, admin only — soft-remove is the update path) |
| `material_versions` | "follows parent" — joins to `materials`/`sessions` and repeats §5.5a's exact predicate | P8 (via a join: `is_presenter_of` on the parent material's `session_id`) | — | — |
| `material_pages` | "follows parent" — same join, **no `allow_download` conjunct** (07 §6: page images are identical either way) | — (worker only, via a future `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC, never a raw grant — CLAUDE.md data-access rule 6) | — | — |
| `session_tasks` | P1 | P8 | P8 (adapted: both `using` and `with check`) | P8 |
| `task_completions` | `member_id = self` **or** presenter-of-the-task's-session (no staff — `03` §5.5 names only "P7 + presenter", and I did not add what is not written) | P3 | P3 | P3 |
| `task_form_responses` | §5.5b (copied) | P3 | P3 | — |
| `photos` | P1 restricted to `hidden_at is null`, **plus `is_staff()`** (a moderator resolving a takedown has to be able to see the hidden row — otherwise `photo_takedowns` "staff read" is pointless) | §5.6c (copied) | P6 (`hidden_at`, `hidden_reason`, `removed_at`, `removed_by`) | — |
| `photo_takedowns` | staff or `requester_id = self`, **plus a `with check` sub-select proving the photo is the caller's own org** (same defensive shape as `ratings_write_self`'s `check_in_id` sub-select) | P3 | P6 (`resolved_at`, `resolution`, `resolved_by`) | — |
| `tags` | P1 | P2 | P2 | P2 (see §1.6 for why I extended this past categories/venues) |
| `session_tags` | P1 | presenter-of-session or admin | — | presenter-of-session or admin |
| `bookmarks` | P7 | P3 | — | P3 |

### 1.4 Two triggers, same reason `comments_guard` exists: a `using`/`with check` clause cannot
express a rule that depends on the *old* row, another table, or "who is allowed to touch this
column right now"

**`materials_guard()`** (`before update`, `security definer`): `session_id`, `kind`, `added_by` are
immutable; setting `removed_at` is refused with `23514` if the session is `completed`/`archived`
**unless** the caller is an org admin (`REQ-MAT-008`: "Presenters can remove their own before the
session completes. Admins can remove any material" — an admin's remove is not time-boxed);
`removed_by` is stamped from `auth_member_id()`, never trusted from the client.

**`photo_takedowns_hide()`** (`after insert`, `security definer`): sets `photos.hidden_at`/
`hidden_reason` the instant a takedown row lands — `REQ-EVT-012`'s "before any human sees the
request", structurally, the same way `photo_takedowns` insert hides "by trigger" is written in `07`
§9.3 and `02` §4.7. It runs as the trigger's owner, so it does not need — and does not get — a
column grant letting the requester write `photos.hidden_at` themselves.

**`photo_takedowns_guard()`** (`before update`, `security definer`): stamps `resolved_by`; when
`resolution = 'restored'`, clears `hidden_at`/`hidden_reason` on the photo. **`resolution =
'removed'`/`'dismissed'` do nothing at the schema level yet** — `07` §9.3 only specifies the
restore path ("a moderator can restore it if the request was mistaken"); the removal audit row and
`05` §2.4's compensating ledger entry are `REQ-EVT-014`'s and belong to `STORY-EVT-006`'s RPC, not
this schema pass. Flagged here the way `event`'s notes flag its own deferred half.

### 1.5 The one real design call worth a second opinion: materials storage reads join back to
Postgres, not just an org prefix

`03` §6's own sample policy for the `materials` bucket only checks the org prefix. But `materials`
and `material-pages` are the two buckets where **phase gating and `allow_download`** matter
(`07` §6, §8), and if a Route Handler ever mints a signed URL using the caller's own JWT rather
than `service_role` (which it must — `service_role` is never on Vercel, invariant 7), then
`storage.objects` RLS is the actual boundary at the moment the URL is created, not a UI nicety.
So `materials_storage_read`/`material_pages_storage_read` join `storage.objects` to
`material_versions → materials → sessions` and repeat §5.5a's exact visibility predicate (plus
`allow_download` for the `materials` bucket only, never for `material-pages`). This is *more*
defensive than the literal `03` §6 sample, not a deviation from it — `03`'s honest-weakness section
already says the org-prefix check is a floor, not a ceiling. **This might deserve a `DECISIONS.md`
entry or a `03` §6 correction the way `event` found one for the Realtime host topic** — the lead's
call, flagged here per the note-taking convention.

**What this schema pass does *not* prove:** "no signed URL is ever minted" when `allow_download`
is off is fundamentally a Route Handler behavior (it never calls the signing API), not something
RLS can assert — RLS can only prove that *if* something asked, it would be refused. The Route
Handler test for STORY-MAT-004 is where the literal invariant gets its real proof; this migration
gives it a second, independent floor.

### 1.6 One judgment call on `tags`, past what `03`'s matrix says

`03` §3's role matrix groups `tags` with `companies`/`categories`/`venues` (read: everyone, write:
admin), and `03` §8.2 gives `companies`/`categories`/`venues` update but explicitly **no delete**
(`REQ-ADM-006`, "no role can delete one"). I gave `tags` a delete policy that the other three don't
get. Reason: `companies`/`categories`/`venues` are referenced by leaderboards and sessions in ways
that make a delete corrupt history; a free-form tag with no downstream leaderboard is exactly the
kind of thing an admin needs to merge/delete typos out of (`REQ-DSC-002`'s "near-duplicates
merge"). **Flagging this rather than asserting it quietly** — if the lead disagrees, dropping the
delete policy is a one-line diff and the test for it comes out with it.

### 1.7 CI's shim — exactly what I need `scripts/ci/roles.sql` to gain (lead-only file)

CI's bare Postgres container has no `storage` schema at all (confirmed: no `create schema storage`
anywhere in `supabase/migrations/`, and `03` §6's own policies have never been promoted before —
this is the **first** migration to touch `storage.objects`). Introspected the real shape from local
Supabase (`127.0.0.1:54322`) rather than guessing, the same way the `realtime` shim was built
(DEC-044's pattern):

```sql
create schema if not exists storage;
grant usage on schema storage to anon, authenticated, service_role;

create table storage.buckets (
  id                 text primary key,
  name               text not null unique,
  owner              uuid,
  public             boolean default false,
  file_size_limit    bigint,
  allowed_mime_types text[],
  created_at         timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at         timestamptz default now()
);

create table storage.objects (
  id         uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  bucket_id  text references storage.buckets(id),
  name       text,
  owner      uuid,
  metadata   jsonb,
  created_at timestamptz default now(),
  updated_at timestamptz default now(),
  unique (bucket_id, name)
);
alter table storage.buckets enable row level security;
alter table storage.objects enable row level security;

create function storage.foldername(name text) returns text[]
language plpgsql immutable as $$
declare _parts text[];
begin
  select string_to_array(name, '/') into _parts;
  return _parts[1 : array_length(_parts,1) - 1];
end $$;

create function storage.filename(name text) returns text
language plpgsql as $$
declare _parts text[];
begin
  select string_to_array(name, '/') into _parts;
  return _parts[array_length(_parts,1)];
end $$;

grant select, insert, update, delete on storage.buckets, storage.objects
  to anon, authenticated, service_role, postgres;
```
(Table shapes and function bodies are copied verbatim from local Supabase's real ones — I did not
invent the split logic.) My migration's own `insert into storage.buckets (...)` and `create policy
… on storage.objects` statements need nothing more than this to apply cleanly.

### 1.8 `03` §8.2 rows this file adds

| Policy | Test |
|---|---|
| `POL-materials.select.phase` | An `after` material is invisible to a member until the session is `completed`; visible to the presenter throughout. |
| `POL-materials.insert.presenter` | A member who is not a presenter cannot add a material. |
| `POL-materials.update.window` | A presenter removes their own material before completion; the same presenter is refused after completion; an admin removes it anyway. |
| `POL-materials.hard_delete.admin_only` | A member and a presenter are refused a hard `delete`; an admin succeeds. |
| `POL-material_versions.select.phase` | Follows the parent material's phase gate exactly. |
| `POL-material_pages.select` | No rows exist for a Keynote material (DEC-006); follows the parent's phase gate with no `allow_download` conjunct. |
| `POL-session_tasks.write.presenter` | A member who is not a presenter cannot insert, update or delete a session task; the presenter and an admin can. |
| `POL-task_form_responses.select` | A moderator reading form responses gets nothing (`REQ-ADM-020`). |
| `POL-photos.insert.checked_in` | A member with a confirmed RSVP and no check-in is rejected; the same member, after checking in, succeeds. |
| `POL-photos.insert.exif` | Inserting with `exif_stripped = false` is rejected by the table constraint. |
| `POL-photo_takedowns.insert` | Inserting hides the photo in the same transaction, before any other read. |
| `POL-photo_takedowns.restore` | A moderator resolving with `restored` unhides the photo; `resolved_by` is stamped, never trusted from the client. |
| `POL-photos.select.hidden` | A hidden photo is invisible to a member, visible to staff. |
| `POL-tags.insert.admin` · `POL-tags.delete.admin` | A member's insert is rejected; an admin's succeeds; a moderator cannot delete a tag, an admin can. |
| `POL-session_tags.write.presenter` | A non-presenter member cannot tag a session they do not present; the presenter and an admin can. |
| `POL-bookmarks.self` | A member reads and writes only their own bookmarks; another member's bookmark is invisible. |
| `POL-search.ar_normalize` | «معرفات» and «مُعرِّفات» normalise to the same string; «إدارة» and «ادارة» too. |
| `POL-storage.materials.prefix` | An authenticated write to another org's prefix is rejected. |
| `POL-storage.materials.download` | With `allow_download = false`, the joined `materials` bucket read policy denies a member (but not the presenter or staff). |
| `POL-storage.material_pages.phase` | An `after` page image is denied to a member before completion, regardless of `allow_download`. |
| `POL-storage.photos.hidden` | A hidden photo's object is denied to a member, permitted to staff. |
| `POL-storage.exports.write` | An authenticated client cannot write to `exports`; only `service_role` can (bypassrls, not a policy). |
| `POL-storage.fonts.read` | Any authenticated member reads the `fonts` bucket with no org prefix required. |

### 1.9 Test file

`tests/rls/content-schema.test.ts`, `applyProposed(tx, "content/0001_m5_schema.sql")` inside each
test's rolled-back transaction, same shape as `realtime.test.ts`. Uses `seed(tx)` — `f.m2.a.published`
(presenter = `members[0]`, attendee `members[1]` confirmed + checked in), `f.m2.a.completed`
(`members[1]` checked in, already rated) — so no new fixture file was needed for this pass.

## 2. What is next, in the order `15-backlog.md` lists it

`src/lib/storage/` (the one path builder, unit-tested — no route or job builds a path any other
way, per the lint-rule intent in `03` §6) → **STORY-MAT-001** (`api/upload/material`, sniffed on
content, SVG-as-`.png` rejected, size limits named) → **MAT-002** (`convert_document`,
`render_pages`, the record-conversion-result `SECURITY DEFINER` RPC `material_pages`/
`render_status`/`font_substitution_warning` need, SCR-013 the viewer with RTL arrow keys) →
**MAT-003** (Keynote messaging) → **MAT-004** (download control route, phase gating already proven
above) → **MAT-005** → **MAT-006** → **EVT-005/006** (photo upload route, EXIF strip before the row
exists, the takedown UI, realtime for the gallery) → **TSK-001/002** → **DSC-001/002/003** →
`REQ-PRO-004` (draft materials on a proposal — small once `materials` exists: attach on SCR-017,
admin-only until publication).

## 3. Status at handoff

Schema written, proven locally with `applyProposed()`, not yet promoted. Sent the lead the CI shim
requirements (§1.7) and the `03` §8.2 rows (§1.8) with "ready for sync." Not waiting on promotion
to start `src/lib/storage/`.
