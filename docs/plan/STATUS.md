# STATUS — read this first, write it last

**Last updated:** 2026-09-13 · **Branch:** `m0/foundation` — seven commits on `main` @ `335bde2`, head is the `docs(plan)` handoff commit after `db739a4`, **PR #2 open to `main`** · **Phase:** **M0 — steps 1, 2, 4, 5 done; steps 3 and 6 are the owner's**

## Where we are

**The planning document set is complete.** All 19 documents specified by `_source-brief.md` §7 are
written, plus `STATUS.md`, `DECISIONS.md` and the root `CLAUDE.md`. `node scripts/traceability.mjs`
exits 0.

**M0 has landed on `m0/foundation` (PR open, not merged).** `src/` gained its first platform code
— `components/ui/icons.tsx`, `components/ui/dialog.tsx`, and the Radix `Direction.Provider` in the
locale layout — with the frozen routes proven byte-identical by the visual diff. `supabase/` is
untouched and the live project was not connected to. See *M0 progress* and *This session*.

**`public/` is no longer untouched.** Commit `3d43108` added ten static constellation assets — four
PNGs, four `constellation-frame-*.svg`, `constellation.svg` and `constellation-static.svg` —
hand-authored art extracted from `src/components/network-bg.tsx`. They are **repo assets, not uploads**,
so invariant 11 / DEC-009 (no SVG uploads, anywhere) is not affected: nothing here passes through
the upload pipeline or renders inside the privileged headless Chromium. No route, component or
frozen contract (`REQ-NFR-019`) references them yet — they are committed art awaiting use.

**Next:** M0 — foundation and de-risking (`14-roadmap.md`). Nothing in M0 is user-visible, and the
existing QA must stay green throughout.

## Status vocabulary

- **Documents:** `draft` · `settled` · `frozen` · `withdrawn`
- **Stories:** `todo` · `in-progress` · `done`

A `settled` or `frozen` document may **only** be changed via a `DECISIONS.md` entry. That is the
rule that keeps a later session from casually rewriting a considered decision.

## Documents

| # | File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | `_source-brief.md` | `frozen` | The brief verbatim. **Never edit.** D1–D68, A1–A32. |

## ✅ Resolved — the three stray test rows are gone

The QA suite was run against production rather than the stub (DEC-023) and wrote three test rows to
the live `registrations` table. **They have been deleted.** Verified: the table went from 22 rows to
**19**, with **zero** `@example.com` rows remaining — 19 is the real pre-launch signup count.

It could not recur: `scripts/qa.mjs` now refuses to start unless `SUPABASE_URL` is localhost, and
`npm run qa` wires the stub itself.

**How it was finally done, worth knowing:** `supabase db query --linked` executes SQL through the
**Management API** using the CLI access token — **no database password needed**. Earlier attempts
failed because the cached pooler URL carries no password and there is no `psql` on this machine.
This is the way to run one-off SQL against production.

## M0 progress

| Task | Status |
|---|---|
| `scripts/traceability.mjs` + gate | ✅ done — 251/64/112, no gaps |
| **Fix `scripts/qa.mjs`** | ✅ done (DEC-023) — **44/44, repeatable**, was crashing |
| `npm run qa` orchestrator | ✅ done — stub + server + suite, wired and torn down |
| ~~Three Supabase projects~~ → **local + CI** (DEC-025) | ✅ **local Supabase running** — 12 containers healthy, both migrations apply to a clean DB. $0 |
| Playwright, jsdom, `@testing-library` | ✅ done — `8587a28`. Vitest `unit` + `components` projects, Playwright `desktop` + `phone`, CI `e2e` job |
| GitHub Actions with the four blocking gates | ✅ done (DEC-028) — 7 jobs; `policy-diff` written and self-tested |
| Monorepo restructure | ✅ done (DEC-029) — the app stays at the root; nothing moves |
| **Font work** (`REQ-DSG-016`, `REQ-INT-009`) | ✅ done — Option A, **DEC-031**, `8b1b705`. `packages/fonts` is the manifest; `fonts:check` gates CI and both images |
| Visual diff of the frozen routes (`npm run visual`) | ✅ done — baseline captured at `.qa-shots/visual/m0-before`, deterministic at 0.000% |
| **Shaping-parity harness (Tiers A and B)** | ✅ done (DEC-024) — `npm run parity`, 7 cases, green, and proven able to fail |
| graphile-worker on Fly + LISTEN/NOTIFY probe | ⬜ **owner's step 3** — needs `flyctl`, not installed tonight by the owner's instruction. `worker/` does not exist yet |
| Credential-free converter app | ✅ built and tested, **not deployed** — **DEC-032**, `converter/`. `fly deploy` is part of the owner's step 3 |
| Radix + the ~8 inline SVGs | ✅ done — `78ff5a6`. `radix-ui` 1.6.7, `Direction.Provider` in the layout, `icons.tsx`, `dialog.tsx`, jsdom tests |
| `NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | ⬜ **owner's step 6** — a Vercel env change, which this session was told not to make. `openssl rand -base64 32`, set for Production **and** Preview, keep it stable (`04` §9.2) |

## The parity spike answered the biggest open question

`npm run parity` — 7 cases, Tiers A and B, green and repeatable. **Headless Chromium holds Arabic
parity**: 0.000% pixel drift between renders, lam-alef forming correctly, stacked tashkeel
positioned and unclipped. A substituted face is caught at 2–10% pixel difference and by advance
drift on every case, verified with `--break-font`.

**So D66 is achievable through this pipeline and M6 can be planned on it.** That was the riskiest
unknown in the product.

Two silent traps found on the way, both recorded in DEC-024 because they will recur in M6:
`font-display: block` hides glyphs while metrics still resolve (blank captures that measure fine),
and in an RTL document an overflowing absolutely-positioned element overflows **leftward**, shifting
the scroll origin so element screenshots capture the wrong region. Both produced blank goldens that
passed everything. The harness now refuses to write a golden below 0.1% inked pixels.

**Not yet covered:** the four export paths of `REQ-DSG-015` (poster PNG/PDF, certificate PDF, slide
page images). Those need the worker image and the designer — M6. The suite is built so each path
plugs into the same seven cases.

## Waiting on the owner

Two M0 steps were explicitly left to the owner tonight, and the PR:

1. **Step 3 — the worker on Fly, with the LISTEN/NOTIFY boot probe.** `flyctl` is not installed
   (owner: "no flyctl tonight"). Nothing of `worker/` exists yet; `converter/fly.toml` and the
   converter image are ready to deploy with
   `fly deploy --config converter/fly.toml --dockerfile converter/Dockerfile .` once the worker
   app exists to call it. `04` §7.2 / `11` §1.2: session-mode port **5432**, never 6543; the probe
   must refuse to start if a `NOTIFY` does not arrive within a second.
2. **Step 6 — `NEXT_SERVER_ACTIONS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`** on Vercel, stable across builds (`04` §9.2,
   §10). This session was instructed not to change Vercel environment variables.
3. **Review and merge PR #2** (`m0/foundation` → `main`). The session was instructed not to
   merge or push to `main`.

## Blockers

**None for the plan.** Every open question carries a default that is already in force, so no work
is blocked on an answer.

**One for the owner:** the three test rows above. Nothing is blocked on it, but the table is meant
to be pristine history.

**Resolved since the plan was written:**

- **DEC-021** — the owner confirmed the Realtime trade (**Option A**): browser Supabase client,
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables, **RLS as the sole boundary**. Server polling is a *rejected*
  alternative, not a standing fallback. M0's spike is now implementation. The practical
  consequence for every later session: **the generated isolation sweep (`03` §8.1) is
  load-bearing** — never weaken it, never skip a table, never let it go red.
- **DEC-022** — the hardening DEC-021 exposed, and the plan had **missed**: Realtime does not
  inherit table RLS for broadcast and presence. Every channel is **private**, `realtime.messages`
  carries its own org-scoped policies, and changes broadcast **from database triggers** rather than
  via Postgres Changes. Written out as `03` §7, with six test cases in §8.2. **The isolation sweep
  does not cover this** — it walks tables, not channel topics, so Realtime needs its own tests.

**Still open, and deliberately parked by the owner:**

- **OQ-026** — hosting region and PDPL. The owner set this aside; the default (stay in
  `ap-southeast-1`) remains in force and nothing is blocked on it. Worth revisiting before real
  member data exists, since it is a configuration change now and a data migration later.

## This session — M0 steps 1, 2, 4 and 5 on `m0/foundation`

`main` was first confirmed deployable (CI green on every push through `335bde2`; the Vercel
Production deployment for it succeeded; all five frozen routes answer on the live domain). Then,
with the owner's approval of the step-1 plan ("Option A"), the branch landed in order:

| Commit | What | Proof |
|---|---|---|
| `0e969fa` | `npm run visual` — before/after diff of the frozen routes | two captures of one build: 0.000% |
| `8b1b705` | **Fonts, Option A — DEC-031.** `packages/fonts` is `ENT-fonts`; web faces are next/font's exact bytes; one merged TTF per weight for LibreOffice; `scripts/fonts/check.mjs` in CI and in the image builds | parity 0.000%; `fonts:check` OK; visual 0.000% |
| `8587a28` | **Playwright, jsdom, Testing Library.** Two Vitest projects; Playwright over `scripts/serve-stub.mjs`; the stub wiring shared in `scripts/lib/stubbed-server.mjs`; CI `e2e` job | 45 unit/component, 10 e2e |
| `78ff5a6` | **Radix + the eight glyphs.** `Direction.Provider` in the layout; `icons.tsx`; `dialog.tsx`; `ui.dialog.close` in both catalogues | QA 44/44; visual 0.000% |
| `db739a4` | **The credential-free converter — DEC-032.** `converter/`: zero-dependency Node over LibreOffice + poppler, boot guard against any credential, fonts from the manifest verified at image build; smoke test + CI `converter` job | smoke 17/17; QA 44/44 |

**Things the next session should know, none of which are in the plan:**

- **`content-visibility: auto` defeats full-page screenshots.** The first visual baseline had
  three solid-navy chapters and would have passed any diff. `visual-diff.mjs` forces the
  sections visible and refuses a capture with a skipped section or text at opacity 0.
- **IBM Plex Sans on Google Fonts is variable.** next/font emits one file for weights 400/500/600
  of the Latin face, which is why three manifest entries share a hash. Plex Sans Arabic is static:
  one file per weight, and four subsets each — the manifest keeps only Arabic and basic Latin
  (DEC-031 says why).
- **Vitest's `components` project must not carry `react-server`**, and next-intl must be inlined
  so `next/navigation` (extensionless, no `exports` map) resolves. Both are in `vitest.config.ts`
  with the reason.
- **Radix's `Direction.Provider` renders nothing**, which is why the layout could change with the
  visual diff at 0.000%. It also does not set `dir` on a dialog — only on primitives that position
  themselves — so a test asserting `dir` on the dialog is wrong, not the provider.
- **Lock file:** regenerated twice with `npm run lockfile` (CI's npm 10, in Docker). Do not
  `npm install` and commit the result.
- **`13` §1 still says Playwright/jsdom are "not installed".** Settled document; left for a DEC.

**Steps 3 and 6 were not done**, by the owner's instruction — see *Waiting on the owner*.

## Next session should

1. Read this file, then `/CLAUDE.md`, then `DECISIONS.md` — DEC-031 and DEC-032 are new.
2. Check whether PR #2 was merged. If yes, `main` carries M0 steps 1, 2, 4, 5; if not, the
   branch is `m0/foundation` and CI on it was green at handoff.
3. **Step 3** once `flyctl` is available: create `worker/` (graphile-worker, Chromium,
   `@kareem/designer-runtime`, fonts from `packages/fonts` verified like the converter does), the
   LISTEN/NOTIFY boot probe, `fly.toml`, and deploy both apps. **Step 6** on Vercel.
4. Then M1 (`14-roadmap.md`) — the dangerous one. Do not compress it.
5. **Do not re-litigate anything in `DECISIONS.md`.** A reversal is a new entry, not an edit.
6. Update this file before finishing.
